## How to use this GitHub:

For each assignment:

1. Create a feature branch in the class GitHub repository for your team. We recommend branching off of the assignment branch for each assignment. Feature branch naming convention: ta#-teamID. If individual team members create their own feature branches, ensure these branches are PR'd into your team feature branch, merged, and deleted prior to submission. **Important** Make sure ALL of your filenames are descriptive of your topic and contain your team ID.

2. Each assignment has its own branch. To submit your code, make a PR into the branch specified in the rubric and add me and the TAs as reviewers. In your PR, add any requirements (and versions) that are not currently in the requirements.txt file to the text of your PR.
